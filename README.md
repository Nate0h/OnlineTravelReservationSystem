# OnlineTravelReservationSystem - CS336

Customer Representative Functionality of the Online Travel Reservation System.

In this project, you will design and implement a relational database system to support the operations of an online travel reservation system. You will use HTML for the user interface, MySQL for the database server, and Java, JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and the database server. You will have to install your own web server that will host your web application (Tomcat) as well as a MySQL server. 

Customer-Representative-Level Functionality:

Customer Representatives should be thought of as reservation agents and should be able to:
 Make flight reservations on behalf of users
 Edit flight reservations for a customer
 Reply to user’s questions
 Add, Edit, Delete information for aircrafts, airports and flights
 Retrieve a list of all the passengers who are on the waiting list of a particular flight
 Produce a list of all flights for a given airport (departing and arriving flights)
